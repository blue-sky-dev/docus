## 📖 Documentation

We are using [Docus](https://nuxtlabs.com/docus) for documentation (*It is planned to be open sourced in the following weeks*).

We recommend to install the [Docus extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=NuxtLabs.docus) for VS Code.

- Run `pnpm stub` once in the root directory
- Go into the docs directory: `cd docs`
- Install docs dependencies with `pnpm install`
- Run `pnpm dev` to start Docus in development mode

The pages are generated from [docs/content/](./docs/content), you can start editing them to start helping us on documenting Nuxt 3 💚
