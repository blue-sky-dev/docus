# Admin

:::alert{type="info"}
Admin is currently under development. Informations below are related to developer experience for the Admin UI.
:::

Admin application is a **Vue 3** app built aside from the current app.

This app exposes an **HTTP API** allowing to perform **read/write** operations on the current project files and directories.

The Docs app is rendered via an `iframe`, content updates are so reflected using **Docus core** and **WebSockets**.

## Start the UI

The admin UI can be launched without the Docs repository, using a command.

```bash
yarn dev:admin
```
