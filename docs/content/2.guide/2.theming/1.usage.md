In general, you'll create your Docus project with the starter, that ships with `@docus/docs-theme`.

If you want to change your theme you can change the `extends` key of your `nuxt.config`.

```diff
export default defineNuxtConfig({
-  extends: ['./node_modules/@docus/docs-theme'],
+  extends: ['./my/theme/path'],
})
```
