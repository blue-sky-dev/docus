If you want to create a theme, the easiest way is to start from our template:

```bash
npx nuxi init docus-theme -t nuxtlabs/docus-theme-starter
```

## How does theming works ?

Docus takes advantage of the new `extends` feature from Nuxt 3 to create a straightforward approach to theming.

Extends feature is capable of merging two or more Nuxt projects, as long as they expose a `nuxt.config` file.

With Docus, themes should extends from [@docus/base](/packages/base/features) to keep the same structure in terms of API, anything else can be customized to your own needs.

## Things to know

Themes has the exact same structure as a regular [Nuxt](https://v3.nuxtjs.org) project.

You can create components or layouts, import plugins, use middlewares, or do anything you would normally do with a Nuxt project.

You can think of your theme as the "shell" of the Docus project that will be using it.

## Publishing

If you want to publish your theme, it is as simple as running `npm publish`{lang="bash"} from the root of your Nuxt project directory.

Do not forget to remove `"private": true`{lang="json"} from your package.json beforehand.
