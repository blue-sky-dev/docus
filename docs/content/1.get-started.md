## Play online

You can start playing with Docus in your browser using our online sandboxes:

:button-link[Play on StackBlitz]{icon="IconStackBlitz" href="https://stackblitz.com/github/nuxt/starter/tree/content" blank .mr-2}
:button-link[Play on CodeSandbox]{icon="IconCodeSandBox" href="https://codesandbox.io/s/github/nuxt/starter/tree/content" blank}

## New Project

1. You can start a fresh Docus project with:

```bash [npx]
npx nuxi init docus-app -t nuxtlabs/docus-starter
```

2. Install the dependencies in the `docus-app` folder:

::code-group
  ```bash [yarn]
  yarn install
  ```

  ```bash [npm]
  npm install
  ```

  ```bash [pnpm]
  pnpm install --shamefully-hoist
  ```
::

3. Now you'll be able to use `yarn dev` to start your Nuxt content app in development mode:

::code-group

```bash [yarn]
yarn dev
```

```bash [npm]
npm run dev
```

```bash [pnpm]
pnpm run dev
```

That project will be shipped with the [Docs Theme](/packages/docs/features).

If you want to change the theme, you can check out the [Guide section](/guide/theming/usage) about it.
