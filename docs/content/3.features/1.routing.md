# Filesystem routing

A good looking website from any directory. ðŸ”®

---

Each markdown page in the `contentDir` directory will become a page and will be listed in the left navigation.

You can also put your markdown files in nested directories to generate nested routes.

**Example**

::code-group

``` [Directory structure]
content/
  examples/
    basic-usage.md
  setup.md
```

``` [Generated routes]
/examples/basic-usage
/setup
```

::

## Ordering

You can easily build the navigation order from any directory using number prefixes.

```
content/
   1.examples/
      index.md
      1.vercel.md
      2.netlify.md
      3.heroku.md
   2.frameworks/
    1.vue.md
    2.nuxt.md 
```

## Ignoring

If you are working on a draft that you do not want to be list in the navigation or accessible via as a separate page, just prefix it with `"."`.

It will ignore this file and it will not be accessible unless you're in **development** or **admin** mode.

You can still use the content from these files using [`InjectContent`](/theme/components#inject-content) component.

```
content/
   1.examples/ 
      .hidden.md // Ignored file
   .2.frameworks/ // Ignored directory
      hidden.md
```

> You can take a look at our [docs content folder](https://github.com/nuxt/content/tree/dev/docs/content/en) to see an example


## Non-Page Contents

If you have some files that you don't want to have them as a separated pages but you want search among them, just prefix it with `"_"`.

The only way to access these files is to use `$docus.search` API or `:InjectContetn` component.

```
content/
   1.examples/ 
      _hidden.md // Filtered file
   _2.frameworks/ // Filters directory
      hidden.md
```

::alert
**Note**: The beginning `_` will remove from document path, and you don't need to use `_` in search queries.
