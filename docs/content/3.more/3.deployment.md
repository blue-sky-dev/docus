# Deployment

> Deploy your documentation with Docus to any static hosting ðŸª¶

To generate the documentation for production, run the following command:

<code-group>
  <code-block label="Yarn" active>

```bash
yarn build
```

</code-block>
<code-block label="NPM">

```bash
npm run build
```

</code-block>
</code-group>

A `dist/` directory will be generated, ready to be deployed on any static host (GitHub Pages, Vercel, Netlify, Surge, etc).

## Github Pages

The best way to deploy Docus on Github Pages is using [Github Actions](https://github.com/features/actions). Github Actions will build, generate and publish your documentation on Github Pages.

If you have a workflow you need to append a new step to your existing workflow.  

```yaml
- name: Deploy
  uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3
  with:
    github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    publish_dir: ./dist
```

**Note**: You must insert this step after `generate`. This step uses the [GitHub Pages Action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/github-pages-action) to push the generated files from the `dist` folder to your default GitHub Pages branch `gh-pages`.

If you don't have a workflow you will need to create a new one. Create a new file called `gh-pages.yml` in `.github/workflows` directory and paste the following content into the file.

```yaml [.github/workflows/gh-pages.yml]
name: gh-pages
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}

    strategy:
      matrix:
        os: [ubuntu-latest]
        node: [14]

    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Setup node env
        uses: actions/setup-node@v2.1.2
        with:
          node-version: ${{ matrix.node }}

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: yarn

      - name: Generate
        run: yarn run nuxt generate

      - name: Deploy
        uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3
        with:
          github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          publish_dir: ./dist
```

Save the file and push it to the repository. Check out the Actions tab in your Github repository and you'll see the running job. Once the job has finished, your site should be live.

## Gitlab Pages

To deploy Docus to Gitlab Pages to can use [`Gitlab CI`](https://about.gitlab.com/stages-devops-lifecycle/continuous-integration/). Gitlab uses specific [artifact](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/pipelines/job_artifacts.html) to detect the public content of your projects and deploy it as static pages.

Create `.gitlab-ci.yml` in the root directory of your project and paste the following content into the file. If you already have `gitlab-ci.yml`, edit the file and add `pages` section into it.

```yaml [.gitlab-ci.yml]
image: node:14

pages:
  script:
    - yarn
    - yarn run nuxt generate
    - mv dist public
  # specify `public` directory for artifacts.
  artifacts:
    paths:
      - public
```

Save the file and push it to the repository. Check out running pipeline in `CI / CD` > `Pipelines` section. When it succeeds, go to `Settings` > `Pages` to view the URL where your site is now available.
